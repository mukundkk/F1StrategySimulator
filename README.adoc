== Introduction

This project aims to simulate the outcome of Formula One races using open-source data from the http://ergast.com/mrd/[Ergast Motor Racing Developer API]. As of now, it is focused on the 2016 F1 season, but more seasons may be added at a later date.

== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites
Java 11 or later is required for this project.

=== Running the Simulator

. Download the newest release
. Enter the directory ~/F1StrategySimulator
. Run ```java -jar /build/libs/F1StrategySimulator.jar``` to start the program..

If you prefer to download the source code as well:

. Clone this repository
. Enter the parent directory ~/F1StrategySimulator
. Run a Gradle build
* ```./gradlew build```
. Run the generated JAR file
* ```java -jar /build/libs/F1StrategySimulator.jar```

== Features
The overall simulator consists of multiple 'models' that predict behavior in certain important subcategories, such as tyre wear and overtakes.

.Core Models
* Tyre Wear
* Fuel Consumption
* Overtaking
* Pit Stop/Tyre Strategy
* DNFs

The results from each of these models are then taken into account and used to predict lap-by-lap results, and eventually the results of the simulated race.

As much of the real-time data collected by Formula One teams is not publically available, these models are limited to and by the open-source data that can be found.

More features will be added in the future - check out <<What Next?>>

== Project Layout

.A description of each relevant directory in ~/src.
|===
|~/src/ |Description

|Data
|Collection of various data incl. driver coefficients, team statistics, and circuit information.

|Evaluation
|Contains the main class from which the program is entered.

|FileIO
|Classes for reading from and writing to race data files.

|Models
|The core of the project â€“ all models that are used in the simulation.

|Util
|Miscellaneous utility classes.

== What Next?

.Planned Features:
* Add data for more seasons (post-2016)
* Dedicated logic to account for increased chance of DNFs and overtaking during the 1st lap
* Add more team-level customization (e.g. stronger/weaker circuits, reliability, etc.)
